 * entities and suppressing the actual ability to delete the entity.  The delete view can be seen as the confirmation
 * page (are you sure you want to?) before the actual delete.
 * <p/>
 * For example: In case of related entities that will not automatically be deleted beforehand,
 * {@link #setDeleteDisabled(boolean)} can be used to disallow the delete action until those related entities have
 * been deleted manually.
