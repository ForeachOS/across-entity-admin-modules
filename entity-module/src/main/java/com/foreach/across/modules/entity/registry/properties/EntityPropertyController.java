 * Generic controller for a single property on an entity.
 * Allows reading and writing a property value, as well as validating a value.
 * <p/>
 * The difference between a {@link #save(EntityPropertyBindingContext, EntityPropertyValue)} and
 * a {@link #applyValue(EntityPropertyBindingContext, EntityPropertyValue)}* method, i
 * s that applying the value can be done several times during a binding process, and is usually
 * done on the entity itself before the entity itself is saved.
 * The {@link #save(EntityPropertyBindingContext, EntityPropertyValue)} method is more
 * useful for properties that are not actually present on the entity instance itself.
 * <p/>
 * The entity the property belongs to is represented in the {@link EntityPropertyBindingContext},
 * which holds the original entity and optionally a different target to which the changes should
 * be applied. The value of {@link EntityPropertyBindingContext#isReadonly()} can be used to
 * determine optimizations in case of an expected readonly situation.
 * <p/>
 * A property value is represented as {@link EntityPropertyValue}. Note that there is no guarantee
 * that {@link EntityPropertyValue#getOldValue()} actually represents the previous value. Especially
 * when working with custom object types it is quite possible that updates have been applied to the
 * same instance, and old value would be the same as the new value. Controllers should be aware of
 * the actual behaviour and should know if they can rely on the contents of the old value.
 * To determine if a property should be deleted, the value of {@link EntityPropertyValue#isDeleted()}
 * can be used.
